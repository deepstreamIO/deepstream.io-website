A quick look at the top-level files and directories you should care about:

    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ content
    â”œâ”€â”€ code-examples
    â”œâ”€â”€ markdown-templates
    â””â”€â”€src


1.  **`/content`**: This directory contains all the content markdown content on the website and is organized into 
the different routes on the application. Adding a document in most cases will automatically add it to the index pages and the navigation menus.

2.  **`/code-examples`**: This directory contains all the example code in the application (mostly guides and plugins).
It's useful to have them live here due to prettify and typescript validation.

4.  **`/markdown-templates`**: This directory contains all the snippets reused across the website (to the horror of search engines). Use and add to these sparingly.

4.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all the react components and styles to render the page. If you feel a component can be displayed better this is the place to be!
