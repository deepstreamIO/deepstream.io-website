Node is the default HTTP server as it supports all platforms and is much easier to debug.

To enable SSL, all you need to do is pass in the the loaded file and cert.

You can either do this using an explicit path:

```yaml
ssl:
  key: fileLoad(/location/to/ssl/key.pem)
  cert: fileLoad(/location/to/ssl/key.pem)
```

or relative to the config file (less likely on a production install):

```yaml
ssl:
  key: fileLoad(ssl/key.pem)
  cert: fileLoad(ssl/key.pem)
```
