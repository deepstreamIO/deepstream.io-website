Http authentication lets you register your own HTTP server's URL as a Webhook. Every time a user tries to login, deepstream will send their credentials via POST request to your server. Depending on your server's response, the user's login will be denied or granted.

Http authentication is the most flexible authentication type as it's completely up to your server to implement an authentication mechanism. You can query a database, contact an oAuth provider, validate a WebToken or whatever else your heart desires.

## Using HTTP Authentication
To enable HTTP authentication, set the `type` to `http` in the `auth` section of the server's [configuration file](/docs/server/configuration/).

```yaml
- type: http
  options:
    endpointUrl: https://someurl.com/auth-user
    permittedStatusCodes: [ 200 ]
    requestTimeout: 2000
    retryStatusCodes: [ 404, 504 ]
    retryAttempts: 3
    retryInterval: 5000
    reportInvalidParameters: true # return when credentials are incorrect: missing username or password
```

In the `options` key, set an `endpointUrl` for an authentication service that deepstream will send a `POST` request to, `permittedStatusCodes` to the list of accepted http codes for successful authentication, and `requestTimeout`is the timeout value (in milliseconds).

[[important]]
| Unless your deepstream and authentication servers are within the same private network, you should use a secure connection (https).

The following payload is sent with the `POST` request for your authentication service to work with.

```json
{
  "connectionData": {...},
  "authData": {...}
}
```

How you construct the service behind the url endpoint is up to you and your application stack, but it should return the relevant http response code and either a `username` string, or a JSON:

```json
{
    "id":"chris",
    "clientData": {},
    "serverData": {}
}
```

The content of `clientData` and `serverData` are up to you, but useful for sending data back to deepstream, with `clientData` available in the `client.login()` callback and `serverData` sent to the permissions handler.

Start the deepstream server and you should see the authentication type confirmed.

This simple node server returns an http code of '200' when a certain username is passed, and '404' if it's any other username:

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
const app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.json())

app.post('/auth-user', (req, res) => {
  if (req.body.authData.username === 'chris') {
    res.json({
      id: 'chris',
      clientData: { themeColor: 'pink' },
      serverData: { role: 'admin' }
    })
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Invalid Credentials')
  }
})

app.listen(3000)
```

In your application code you can now connect to the deepstream server and try to login a user. Try changing the value of username to something aside from 'chris' to see what happens.

`embed: js/login-es6.js`

If a success, the deepstream console will show:

And if a failure:
