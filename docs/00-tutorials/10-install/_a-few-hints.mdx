## A few hints

deepstream binary comes pre-installed with the following connectors:
- cache redis
- cache memcached
- clusternode redis
- storage rethinkdb
- storage postgres
- storage mongodb
- storage elasticsearch
- logger winston

deepstream's configuration file can be written in both YAML or JSON. deepstream will automatically choose the right parser, based on the file-extension.

Some core configuration options can be overridden via commandline parameters, e.g. `--host`, `--port` or `--disable-auth`. For a full list, just run `deepstream start --help`

The configuration file contains relative paths, e.g. for ./permissions.yml or users.yml. If you run the file from another location, make sure to update them. The paths are relative to the directory the main config file resides in.
