Events are deepstream's implementation of the publish/subscribe pattern. You can find more about how they are used in the [events tutorial](/tutorials/core/pubsub/).

## Methods

### client.event.subscribe( event, callback )

|Argument|Type|Optional|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|event|String|false|An eventname|
|callback|Function|false|A function that will be called whenever the event is emitted|

Subscribes to an event. Callback will receive the data passed to `emit()`

```javascript
// Client A
client.event.subscribe('news/sports', data => {
  // handle published data
})

// Client B
client.event.emit('news/sports', /* data */)
```

### client.event.unsubscribe( event, callback )

|Argument|Type|Optional|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|event|String|false|An eventname|
|callback|Function|true|The callback that was previously registered with subscribe. If the callback is omitted, all listeners for the event will be removed|

Unsubscribes from an event that was previously registered with `subscribe()`. This stops a client from receiving the event.

```javascript
// Client A
client.event.unsubscribe('news/politics', callback)
```

### client.event.emit( event, data )

|Argument|Type|Optional|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|event|String|false|An eventname|
|data|Mixed|true|Any serialisable data ( Objects, Strings, Numbers... ) that will be sent with the event|

Sends the event to all subscribed clients

```javascript
// Client B
client.event.emit('notifications', 'Maria just came online')
```

### client.event.listen( pattern, callback )

|Argument|Type|Optional|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|pattern|String (regex)|false|The pattern to match events which subscription status you want to be informed of|
|callback|Function|false|A function that will be called whenever an event matching the `pattern` has been initially subscribed to. When there are no more subscriptions to any events matching `pattern`, the callback passed to `response.onStop()` is called. Arguments are (String) match, and response (Object)|

Registers the client as a listener for event subscriptions made by other clients. This is useful to create active data providers - processes that only send events if clients are actually interested in them. You can find more about listening in the [events tutorial](/tutorials/core/pubsub/#how-to-listen-for-event-subscriptions).

The callback is invoked with two arguments:
- **match**: the name of the event that has been matched against the provided pattern
- **response**: contains two functions (`accept` and `reject`), one of them needs to be called

```javascript
client.event.listen('^news/.*', (match, response) => {
  // see tutorial for more details
})
```

### client.event.unlisten( pattern )

|Argument|Type|Optional|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|pattern|String (regex)|false|he previously registered pattern|

This removes a previously registered listening pattern and the user will no longer be listening for active/inactive subscriptions.

```javascript
client.event.unlisten('^news/.*')
```
