import NodeHttpServerConfig from './_node-http-server-config.mdx'
import UwsHttpServerConfig from './_uws-http-server-config.mdx'

You can make any configuration changes you need for your deepstream setup in the
*config.yml* file or in the options object passed to the deepstream constructor when using the node API.
Depending on the installation sources, the configuration can
be found in
- in the folder `conf` in the Node.js module directory if you installed with
  `npm`, or
- in the folder `conf` after unpacking the standalone server binary.

:::info
The default server configuration can be found on the [source code here](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/blob/master/src/default-options.ts)
:::

## Macros

Before we start diving into config, lets look at the current macros we have in order
to make our lives a little bit easier:

- `${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE}`

This is the usual replace environment variable into my config before running, useful
in around 100% of deployment usecases.

- `file(relative/path)`

This allows the server to binary to point to the file relative to your config file. This
is pretty useful for global and binary installs.

- `fileLoad(relative/path)`

This is more of a utility for us plugin developers, it automatically loads up the data
and parses it (if json or yml). This means node developers can now just deal with writing
everything as parsed data and leave loading / parsing and errors to deepstream startup.


## General Configuration

In this section you can change general settings for each server in a cluster.

```yaml
# general configuration with default values
serverName: UUID
showLogo: true
dependencyInitializationTimeout: 2000
exitOnFatalError: false
logLevel: INFO
#libDir: ../lib
```

### serverName
Every server in a cluster of servers needs a unique name. You can add your own or set it to `UUID` to let deepstream auto-generate a unique ID.

_Default_: `UUID`

### showLogo
When starting, a server can show the deepstream logo. This setting is best left enabled.

_Default_: `true`

### logLevel
The logLevel to use across the application. Sets at what level and above the server should log messages. Valid levels are `DEBUG`, `INFO`,
`WARN`, `ERROR`, and `OFF`.

_Default_: INFO

### dependencyInitializationTimeout
Sets how long deepstream will wait for dependencies to initialize.

_Default_:`2000`

### exitOnFatalError
Exit if a fatal error occurs

_Default_: false

### libDir
The directory where all the plugins reside, this is used in standalone binaries

_Default_: None, it assumes all plugins are installed via npm

## Features configuration
This disables specific feature in deepstream, which is a more performant way than disabling via permissions and is also how telemetry figures out what features are enabled.

```yaml
enabledFeatures:
  record: true
  event: true
  rpc: true
  presence: true
```

## RPC Configuration

### ackTimeout
Sets how long deepstream will wait for a RPC provider to acknowledge receipt of a request.

_Default_:`1000`

### responseTimeout
Sets how long deepstream will wait for RPCs to complete before sending a response timeout error.

_Default_:`10000`

### provideRequestorName
Send requestorName by default.

_Default_:`true`

### provideRequestorData
Send requestorData by default.

_Default_:`true`

## Record Configuration

### cacheRetrievalTimeout
Sets how long deepstream will wait when retrieving values from the cache.

_Default_:`1000`

### storageRetrievalTimeout
Sets how long deepstream will wait when retrieving values from the database.

_Default_:`2000`

### storageExclusionPrefixes
A list of prefixes that, when a record starts with one of the prefixes the
records data won't be stored in the db

_Default_: `[]`

### storageHotPathPrefixes
A list of prefixes that designate a record for direct writes to storage.
When a correctly permissioned matching record is updated via `setData()`, it will be written
directly to the cache and storage without a record transition. This can be up to twice as fast as
updating a normal record using `setData()`

_Default_: `[]`

## Listening

### shuffleProviders
Try finding a provider randomly rather than by the order they subscribed to.

_Default_: true

### responseTimeout
The amount of time to wait for a provider to acknowledge or reject a listen request

_Default_: 500

### rematchInterval
The amount of time before trying to reattempt finding matches for subscriptions. This
is not a cheap operation so it's recommended to raise keep this at minutes rather then
second intervals if you are experiencing heavy loads

_Default_: 30000

### matchCooldown
The amount of time a server will refuse to retry finding a subscriber after a previously
failed attempt. This is used to avoid servers constantly trying to find a match without a
cooldown period

_Default_: 10000

## Connection Endpoint Configuration

Deepstream (v5 and later) runs all websocket / HTTP services in one server to which they hook to provide their own functionality. This means you can run all the services at the same time on the same port if you want (for example text, binary and JSON). The idea is that *EVERYTHING* (minus MQTT) runs on port 6020, which makes deployments much easier.

<NodeHttpServerConfig/>

OR

<UwsHttpServerConfig/>

The server can be configured with custom connection endpoints. You can supply as many as you want, each as any individual list entry below the `connectionEndpoints` key:

```yaml
# Connection Endpoint Configuration
connectionEndpoints:
  - type: ws-binary
    options:
      # url path websocket connections connect to
      urlPath: /deepstream
      # the amount of milliseconds between each ping/heartbeat message
      heartbeatInterval: 30000
      # the amount of milliseconds that writes to sockets are buffered
      outgoingBufferTimeout: 0
      # the maximum amount of bytes to buffer before flushing, stops the client from large enough packages
      # to block its responsiveness
      maxBufferByteSize: 100000

      # Security
      # should the server log invalid auth data, defaults to false
      logInvalidAuthData: false
      # amount of time a connection can remain open while not being logged in
      unauthenticatedClientTimeout: 180000
      # invalid login attempts before the connection is cut
      maxAuthAttempts: 3
      # maximum allowed size of an individual message in bytes
      maxMessageSize: 1048576

  - type: ws-text
    options:
      # url path websocket connections connect to
      urlPath: /deepstream-v3
      # the amount of milliseconds between each ping/heartbeat message
      heartbeatInterval: 30000
      # the amount of milliseconds that writes to sockets are buffered
      outgoingBufferTimeout: 0
      # the maximum amount of bytes to buffer before flushing, stops the client from large enough packages
      # to block its responsiveness
      maxBufferByteSize: 100000

      # Security
      # should the server log invalid auth data, defaults to false
      logInvalidAuthData: false
      # amount of time a connection can remain open while not being logged in
      unauthenticatedClientTimeout: 180000
      # invalid login attempts before the connection is cut
      maxAuthAttempts: 3
      # maximum allowed size of an individual message in bytes
      maxMessageSize: 1048576

  - type: ws-json
    options:
      # url path websocket connections connect to
      urlPath: /deepstream-json
      # the amount of milliseconds between each ping/heartbeat message
      heartbeatInterval: 30000
      # the amount of milliseconds that writes to sockets are buffered
      outgoingBufferTimeout: 0
      # the maximum amount of bytes to buffer before flushing, stops the client from large enough packages
      # to block its responsiveness
      maxBufferByteSize: 100000

      # Security
      # should the server log invalid auth data, defaults to false
      logInvalidAuthData: false
      # amount of time a connection can remain open while not being logged in
      unauthenticatedClientTimeout: 180000
      # invalid login attempts before the connection is cut
      maxAuthAttempts: 3
      # maximum allowed size of an individual message in bytes
      maxMessageSize: 1048576

  - type: http
    options:
      # allow 'authData' parameter in POST requests, if disabled only token and OPEN auth is
      # possible
      allowAuthData: true
      # enable the authentication endpoint for requesting tokens/userData.
      # note: a custom authentication handler is required for token generation
      enableAuthEndpoint: true
      # path for authentication requests
      authPath: /api/auth
      # path for POST requests
      postPath: /api
      # path for GET requests
      getPath: /api
      # should the server log invalid auth data, defaults to false
      logInvalidAuthData: false
      # http request timeout in milliseconds, defaults to 20000
      requestTimeout: 20000

  - type: mqtt
    options:
        # port for the mqtt server
        port: 1883
        # host for the mqtt server
        host: 0.0.0.0
        # timeout for idle devices
        idleTimeout: 60000
```

### Websockets

The websocket endpoints share the following options:

#### urlPath
Sets which URL path Websocket connections should connect to.

_Default_: `/deepstream`

#### heartbeatInterval
The number of milliseconds between each ping/heartbeat message.

_Default_: `30000`

#### unauthenticatedClientTimeout
The amount of time a connection can remain open while not being logged in.

_Default_: `180000`

#### maxAuthAttempts
Invalid login attempts before the connection is cut.

_Default_: `3`

#### logInvalidAuthData
Controls whether logs should contain the cleartext usernames and passwords of invalid login
attempts.

_Default_: false

#### maxMessageSize
Sets the maximum message size allowed to be sent to the server (in bytes).

_Default_: `1048576`

### outgoingBufferTimeout
The amount of milliseconds that secondary writes to sockets are buffered. This means
writes that are not realtime critical, which currently are either ACKs or
non critical ERROR messages.

_Default_: `0`

## Custom Plugin Configuration

You can extend deepstream with plugins for connectors to other services, these
are for logging, storage engines, caching layers, and message systems. To enable
a plugin, uncomment the relevant category key underneath the `plugins` key. Each
plugin type has a path or name, and a set of options.

```yaml
# Plugin example using redis
plugins:
  myCustomPlugin:
    path: ./my-custom-plugin
    options:
       host: localhost
       port: 5672
```

### path
Set a path to a JavaScript file, node module or a folder with an _index.js_ file which exports a constructor.

### name
If you are using any of the official deepstream connectors, add the name of what the plugin connects to here, for example `redis`.

:::note
 You can set `path` **or** `name`, but not both.
:::

### options
Under this key, add sub key/value pairs to set the configuration options that are passed to the plugin. Each plugin should mention what configuration options you can set.

## Logger

deepstream uses by default a logger which prints out to _stdout_ (errors and warnings to _stderr_). You can set these options for the default logger by using the same configuration style for the plugins:

```yaml
logger:
  type: default
  options:
    colors: true
```

### colors
Sets whether the server's logs should output in color. This will look great in a console, but will
leave color markers in log files if you redirect the output into a file.

_Default_: `true`

## Authentication

In this section you can configure the authentication types the server uses.

You set the authentication type as a subkey in the `auth` key. The available
authentication options are `none`, `file`, `storage` and `http`, each of them having
different `options` which are described in the tutorials on [Auth
None](../../00-tutorials/20-core/20-auth/00-auth-introduction.md), [file-based
authentication](../../00-tutorials/20-core/20-auth/20-file.mdx), [storage-based
authentication](../../00-tutorials/20-core/20-auth/21-storage.mdx), [HTTP
authentication](../../00-tutorials/20-core/20-auth/30-http-webhook.mdx), and [JWT authentication](../../00-tutorials/20-core/20-auth/40-jwt-auth.md) respectively.

You can set multiple authentication types simultaneously and the incoming connection will be validated against each of them until one succeeds or all fail. Authentication strategies will be queried in the same order they are declared on the configuration file.


```yaml
#Authentication
auth:
  - type: none
```

_Default_: `none`

## Permissioning

In this section you can configure the
[permissioning](../../00-tutorials/20-core/30-permission/10-valve-introduction.md). The key used for this
section is `permission` and you can create your own custom permission handler or
use a configuration file. To use the former method, select the option
`type: none` and override the `permissionHandler` with the aid of the [NodeJS
server API](30-node-api.md). To use the latter method, set `type: config` and modify the `option` values below.

```yaml
# Permissioning example with default values for config-based permissioning
permission:
  type: config
  options:
    path: ./permissions.yml
    maxRuleIterations: 3
    cacheEvacuationInterval: 60000
```

### path
Set the path to the file that declares permissions. This option is **mandatory**
with `type: config`. The file can be in JSON, JavaScript, or YAML format. By
default, deepstream ships with a `permissions.yml` permitting every action.

### maxRuleIterations
The deepstream permissions model allows for some complex nested actions and queries. To prevent a performance hit you can limit the nesting level with this option.

_Default_: `3`

### cacheEvacuationInterval
The results of permission checks are cached to improve performance. Use this setting to change the time interval (in milliseconds) that the cache is regenerated.

_Default_: `60000`

## Storage and Cache

Storage and Cache plugins can be configured as follows, please look at [storage](../../00-tutorials/60-plugins/30-database/10-postgres.md) and
[cache](../../00-tutorials/60-plugins/20-cache/10-redis.md) connectors for in depth tutorials how to configure them.

```yaml
cache:
  name: redis
  options:
    host: localhost
    port: 6379

storage:
  name: postgres
  options:
    user: postgres
    database: postgres
    password: mysecretpassword
    host: 'localhost'
    port: 5432
```

_Default_: in memory cache and no storage.

## Monitoring

Set monitoring options.

```yaml
monitoring:
  type: none

  # # Allows monitoring stats to be requested via HTTP, useful for polling agents
  # # such as LogStash
  # type: http
  # options:
  #   url: /monitoring
  #   allowOpenPermissions: false
  #   headerKey: deepstream-password2
  #   headerValue: deepstream-secret

  # # Logs monitoring stats, useful for kibana where you can visualize meta data
  # type: log
  # options:
  #   logInterval: 30000
  #   monitoringKey: DEEPSTREAM_MONITORING
```

_Default_: `none`

## Clusternode

Configuration options for deepstream clusters. Deepstream comes with two possible cluster modes: no cluster and [vertical cluster](../../00-tutorials/60-plugins/50-clusternode/vertical.md) in order to use all CPU cores.
See [here](../../00-tutorials/60-plugins/50-clusternode/redis.md) in order to use redis as cluster connector in multiple machine deployments.

```yaml
clusterNode:
  type: default
  #name: vertical
```

_Default_: `none`

### Lock registry

The lock registry is responsible for maintaing a single source of truth within the cluster, used mainly for issuing cluster wide locks when an operation that stretches over multiple nodes are required. For example, distributed listening requires a leader to drive the nodes in sequence, so issuing a lock prevents multiple nodes from assuming the lead.

Check the default server configuration for details, [source code here](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/blob/master/src/default-options.ts)

### Cluster registry

 This class maintains a list of all nodes that are currently present within the cluster. It provides status messages on a predefined interval and keeps track of incoming status messages.

Check the default server configuration for details, [source code here](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/blob/master/src/default-options.ts)

### Cluster States

 This class provides a generic mechanism that allows to maintain a distributed state amongst the nodes of a cluster. The state is an array of unique strings in arbitrary order. Whenever a string is added by any node within the cluster for the first time,
 an 'add' event is emitted. Whenever its removed by the last node within the cluster, a 'remove' event is emitted.

Check the default server configuration for details, [source code here](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/blob/master/src/default-options.ts)

## Custom Plugins

Deepstream can be extended with any plugin via the [plugin API](../../00-tutorials/70-custom-plugins/10-an-overview.md). Custom plugins can be declared as follows:

```yaml
plugins:
  custom:
    path: '...'
```
