  name: UNSOLICITED_MESSAGE
  description: A message was received that the client didn't expect, e.g. an update for a record that the client isn't subscribed to. This doesn't necessarily have to be an error, but can also be the result of messages crossing on the wire, e.g. when an outgoing record discard and an incoming message overlap.

-
  name: MESSAGE_PARSE_ERROR
  description: The client has received a syntactically incorrect message.
  server: ✔
  client: ✔

  description: Emitted when the client tries to authenticate against an already closed connection.
  server: ''
  client: ✔

-
  name: VERSION_EXISTS
  description: The client has tried to update a record to a version that the server already has. This might happen if multiple clients try to update the same record at the same time. This error will also be emitted by the affected Record. To mitigate this error, configure a [merge strategy](/tutorials/core/handling-data-conflicts/)
  server: ✔
  client: ✔

  description: Emitted when <code>client.record.unlisten( pattern )</code> is called for a pattern that no listener exists for.
  server: ''
  client: ✔

-
  name: TOO_MANY_AUTH_ATTEMPTS
