- Enabling auth using the [storage adaptor](/tutorials/core/auth/storage/)
- Creating a [record](/tutorials/core/datasync/records/) to represent each postit, subscribing and updating its content
- Creating a [list](/tutorials/core/datasync/lists/) to represent the board
- Applying some really [basic permissions](/tutorials/core/permission/valve-simple/) to stop users for editing postits that isn't theirs
